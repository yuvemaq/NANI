# NANI

### NANI (Newborn Application for Nursing Itinerary) is a software application that records the date and time of when you put your baby to sleep, when you feed them, and when you changed their diaper. I built this application for myself and my husband, who as new parents are finding ways to be more organized in preparation of our baby. The conventional method of updating an Google sheets or Excel file seemed outdated and inefficient, hence the birth of this application. 

## Functionalities:

PySimpleGUI Interface - Enter your name, click on the current date from the calendar, and choose what kind of nursing you are recording (sleep, feeding, or diaper). This will automatically save it to a database.
