# NANI

### NANI (Newborn Application for Nursing Itinerary) is a software application that records the date and time of when you put your baby to sleep, when you feed them, and when you changed their diaper. I built this application for myself and my husband, who as new parents are finding ways to be more organized in preparation for our baby. The conventional method of updating a Google sheets or Excel file seemed outdated and inefficient, hence the birth of this application. 

## Functionalities:

PySimpleGUI Interface - Enter your name, click on the current date from the calendar, and choose what kind of nursing you are recording (sleep, feeding, or diaper). This will automatically save it to a database.

## How it works:

Data entry using Google Sheets, attaching a Google Script. Once this is deployed, it will output a URL that in turn accepts post requests. HTML code is used to built out a form that passes data to the Google Sheet.

## Limits:

Currently developing an Android version for this, as well as adding features such as recording vitals, weight, and age. If you have any ideas, feel free to message me about it through my website https://yuvemaq.github.io/ymk.github.io/
